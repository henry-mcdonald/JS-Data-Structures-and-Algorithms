For this deliverable you will be implementing some of the datastructures and alogrithms we have studied in Python except this it its going to be in...Javascript! 🎉

### Getting started

* Fork and clone this repo
* Starter `.js` files have been provided for each part of this deliverable
* Have fun hacking!

## Part 1: Stack Data Structure in JS

___

You will need to create a `stack` data structure for this protion of the deliverable

You can use the `Stack.js` for your `Stack` class. The constructor of your `Stack` class will need to keep track of all data in the stack.

The `Stack` class will need the following methods:

| Method | Functionality |
|--------|---------------|
`size` | Returns the (int) size of the stack |
`isEmpty` | Returns True if stack is empty, False otherwise |
`push` | Adds an item to the stack -- returns new size of the stack |
`pop` | Removes an item from the stack -- returns new size of the stack |
`peek` | Returns the first item in the stack but doesn't remove it |
`print` | Prints all items in the stack |

## Part 2: Queue Data Structure in JS

___

You will need to create a `queue` data structure for this part of the deliverable

You can use `Queue.js` for your `Queue` class. The constructor of your `Queue` class will need to keep track of all data in the queue.

The `Queue` class will need the following methods:

| Method | Functionality |
|--------|---------------|
`size` | Returns the (int) size of the the queue |
`isEmpty` | Returns True if the queue is empty, False otherwise |
`enqueue` | Adds an item to the the queue -- returns new size of the queue |
`dequeue` | Removes an item from the the queue -- returns new size of the queue|
`peek` | Returns the first item in the the queue but doesn't remove it |
`print` | Prints all items in the the queue |

## Part 3: Implement Bubble Sort in JS

For this part of the deliverable, you will need to implement the `Bubble Sort` algorithm in Javascript.

There is a starter array of data in bubbleSort.js for you to use.

* *Don't use any built-in sort functions*
* *The array must be sorted in place -- don't return a new array*
